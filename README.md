Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm on a graph supporting simple integer weights. Your input will consist of a number of vertices and a list of doubly-connected edges along with their costs; your output will consist of a simple representation of the Dijkstra spanning tree.

Specifics

Use whatever collections from the standard Java library you wish.
Your edges only need integer weights; your vertexes only need to be “named” by their implicit serial number.
When you have a choice between two vertices, always choose the lower-numbered vertex.
